# Banana Quality Dataset
## Overview
The Banana Quality dataset contains attributes of bananas and their corresponding quality ratings. 
This dataset is useful for analyzing and predicting the quality of bananas based on various features. The dataset includes information such as size, weight, sweetness, softness, and other attributes that influence banana quality.

Number of Features: 7
Target Variable: Quality

## Column Descriptions
1. Size: Size of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
2. Weight: Weight of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
3. Sweetness: Sweetness level of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
4. Softness: Softness level of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
5. HarvestTime: Time of harvest (numerical value, normalized)
6. Ripeness: Ripeness of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
7. Acidity: Acidity level of the banana (numerical value, normalized)
8. Quality: Quality rating of the banana (categorical: Good, Bad, etc.)

## Learning outcomes
The Banana Quality dataset is used for supervised learning. This is because it includes a target variable, Quality, which you want to predict based on the other features such as Size, Weight, Sweetness, etc.

In supervised learning, the goal is to build a model that can predict the target variable based on the input features. Here, you would use the features to predict the quality of the bananas.
